package ai.vital.aspen.groovy.step


// this is an interface or an abstract class for analysis "steps"
// a step is meant to take an incoming vital object, perform analysis, and output
// an updated object plus potentially additional subsumed objects

// generally the analysis is contained within the input, as opposed to computing some global state
// such as pagerank

// an example is NLP with the input being an object containing text to be analyzed
